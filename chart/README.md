You can use any charting library with Gramex. We recommend the following.

## Gramex Charts

[Gramex Charts](https://gramener.com/gramexcharts/) is a
gallery of user-contributed configurable charts. This features charts from
multiple libraries. You can embed the relevant one based on your needs.

## Vega

[Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega/) is a high-level implementation of the grammar
of graphics, allowing the creation of charts with the power of D3 but with
greater ease.

To learn Vega, read the [Vega tutorial](http://gramener.github.io/vegatutorial/).

## D3

[D3](https://d3js.org/) is a powerful low-level JavaScript library that can bind
visual features to data, allowing creation of custom charts.

## Deprecations

- [Chartogram](gallery.html) is a deprecated gallery of Vega charts
- [Gramex Charts](https://learn.gramener.com/gc) (old) is a deprecated library to create charts.
