## DriveHandler manages files

[DriveHandler](../../drivehandler/) is a FormHandler-compatible replacement for
[UploadHandler](../../uploadhandler/). It makes it easy to create a Dropbox or
Google Drive clone within Gramex.

## Bug fixes

- [CaptureHandler](../../capturehandler/) ignores HTTPS errors. This prevents
  failures with outdated certificates
  [#225](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/225) [Mohammad Niyas]
- [FileHandler](../../filehandler/)
  - no longer fails to guess the MIME type for capital extensions (e.g. `.JPG`).
    [#213](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/213) [Pratap Vardhan]
  - preserves query parameters on redirect.
    [#221](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/221)
  - does not expose `.git/` directories or other hidden sub-directories.
    [#227](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/227)
- `gramex.cache.open` maps the `.h5` extension to HDF files

removed.
